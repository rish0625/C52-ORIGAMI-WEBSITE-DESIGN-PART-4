            <p><i> History </i></p>
            <ul>
                <li> Origami is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. </li>
                <li> In modern usage, the word "origami" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin.</li>
                <li> Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). </li>
                <li> Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes). </li>
                <li> An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish. </li>
            </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Pigeons are one of only a small number of species to pass the 'mirror test' – a test of self recognition. </li>
                    <li> They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
                    <li> Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. </li>
                    <li> Both female and male pigeons share responsibility of caring for and raising young. </li>
